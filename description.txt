DEVKIT-MPC5744P board: FlexCAN Example
MPC5744P sends CAN message "Hello".
The macros DEVKIT and LOOPBACK in can.h determine mode of operation of this demo.
DEVKIT = 1 if using XDEVKIT-MPC5744P, LOOPBACK = 1 if using loopback function.
DEVKIT MUST use LOOPBACK mode. This code example ships configured for DEVKIT and loopback.
CAN message "Hello" is sent from either CAN_2 if using DEVKIT or CAN_0 if using MB.
Receiver in loopback mode is same CAN as the transmitting CAN (CAN_2 or CAN_0).
If not in loopback mode, CAN_1 is the receiver.
In all cases, the buffer RxDATA gets the message "Hello World".
Check the UART terminal to see operation.
The UART will print the RxDATA before and after CAN transmission.
